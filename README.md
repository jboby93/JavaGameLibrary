# JavaGameLibrary
Simplistic 2D game framework in Java using Swing

This is a project that grew from something I did in my senior year of high school, where I developed a Pong clone in Visual Basic in the back row of computer programming class.  This somehow resulted in the class taking a day off from the curriculum to play this game and determine the best Pong player (it wasn't me) and have a discussion on software development and feedback.  I can say that's probably what sparked my continued interest in programming and game development.

What's uploaded here is the result of years of reworking the core parts of that game in Visual Basic, rewritten entirely at least 3 times and then later ported to Java for cross-platform compatibility.  It started as a small messy thing that glitched sometimes if the ball hit the paddle wrong, and developed steadily along with my programming knowledge throughout my computer science program at Penn State.

There are still probably some imperfections and I haven't updated it in a good while, but it's always been a fun little project for me to work on.

There are 3 feature demos included in the package com.jboby93.jgl_test.
